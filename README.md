# Filtering-the-Noise: ML for Trustworthy Location Reviews

Online reviews shape how people perceive local businesses and locations. Yet, irrelevant, misleading, or low-quality reviews can distort reputation and mislead users.

This project—developed for a hackathon challenge—leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically evaluate the quality and relevancy of Google location reviews, aligning them with platform policies.

The goal is to:
- Improve review reliability
- Enhance user trust
- Support fair representation for businesses




## Problem Statement

We design and implement an ML-based system that:

Gauges review quality → Detects spam, ads, irrelevant rants, and fake experiences.

Assesses relevancy → Ensures reviews genuinely relate to the business or location.

Enforces policies → Flags or filters reviews violating rules such as:

❌ No advertisements/promotions

❌ No irrelevant/off-topic content

❌ No fake rants from non-visitors




## Motivation & Impact

For Users → Increases trust in reviews, leading to smarter decisions.

For Businesses → Reduces malicious/irrelevant reviews, ensuring fairer reputation.

For Platforms → Automates moderation, reducing manual effort while improving credibility.
